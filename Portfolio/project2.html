    Research summary
</h1>
<h2 class="userflow-text" >
    Many ballerinas experience very low self-esteem, are self destructive and judge themselves for some extra pounds. Results showed that the most common psychological and emotional needs were for motivation and support. In terms of sharing experiences and helping each other, the results showed that ballet dancers rely heavily on online communities and forums to connect and share their experiences. The most effective methods for an online platform to support and facilitate the sharing of content were identified as being social media integration, and the ability to post and comment on content.

        As a ballerina... <br>
        I would like to receive customized resources and advice tailored to my individual needs. <br>
        I would like to connect with other ballerinas in a safe and supportive environment. <br>
        I would like to share my stories and experiences to inspire others. <br>
        I would like to discover new training techniques and exercises.
